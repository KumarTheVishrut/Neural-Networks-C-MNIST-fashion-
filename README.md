This code defines a **Neuron class**, which is part of a neural network implementation. Here's an explanation of its components and functionality:

---

### **Header Guards**
```cpp
#ifndef _NEURON_HPP_
#define _NEURON_HPP_
```
- These prevent multiple inclusions of the `Neuron.hpp` file during compilation.
- The `#ifndef` checks if `_NEURON_HPP_` is not defined, and if so, defines it and includes the file content. Otherwise, it skips the file.

---

### **Included Libraries**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
```
- `#include <iostream>`: Allows for input/output operations (e.g., printing values).
- `#include <cmath>`: Provides mathematical functions (e.g., `std::abs` for absolute value).
- `using namespace std`: Makes the standard namespace functions and objects (like `std::cout`) accessible without the `std::` prefix.

### **Neuron Class**
The `Neuron` class models a single neuron in a neural network, which performs operations like activation and derivation.

#### **Public Section**
1. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   Neuron(double val);
   ```
   - Initializes a neuron with a specific value (`val`), likely representing the input to the neuron.

2. **Activation Function**
   ```cpp
   void activate();
   ```
   - Applies an activation function to the input value (`val`) to calculate an "activated" value (`acti_val`), simulating how biological neurons fire signals.

   Example Activation Function:
   - \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + |x|} \)

3. **Derivative Function**
   ```cpp
   void derive();
   ```
   - Calculates the derivative of the activation function based on the "activated" value (`acti_val`). This derivative is used during the backpropagation phase in neural networks to adjust weights.

   Example Derivative:
   - \( f'(x) = f(x) \times (1 - f(x)) \)

4. **Getter Methods**
   ```cpp
   double getVal() { return this->val; }
   double getActivatedVal() { return this->acti_val; }
   double getDerivatedVal() { return this->der_val; }
   ```
   - These functions return the internal values of the neuron:
     - **`getVal()`**: Returns the raw input value (`val`).
     - **`getActivatedVal()`**: Returns the activated value (`acti_val`).
     - **`getDerivatedVal()`**: Returns the derivative value (`der_val`).

---

#### **Private Section**
```cpp
private:
    double val;        // Input value to the neuron
    double acti_val;   // Activated value (after applying the activation function)
    double der_val;    // Derivative of the activation value (used in backpropagation)
```
- These are internal properties of the neuron:
  1. **`val`**: Raw input value.
  2. **`acti_val`**: Result after applying the activation function.
  3. **`der_val`**: Result after calculating the derivative of the activation function.

---

### **Footer**
```cpp
#endif
```
- Closes the header guard.

---

### **Usage in a Neural Network**
The `Neuron` class is a fundamental building block for a neural network. A typical neural network would use many `Neuron` instances connected together to:
1. Take inputs.
2. Process them through activation functions in each neuron.
3. Backpropagate errors using derivatives to optimize the network during training.

---

### Potential Implementation Example
Here's how the `Neuron` class might be used in a program:

```cpp
#include "Neuron.hpp"

int main() {
    // Create a neuron with an initial value
    Neuron n(0.5);

    // Activate the neuron
    n.activate();

    // Get and print the activated value
    std::cout << "Activated Value: " << n.getActivatedVal() << std::endl;

    // Calculate the derivative
    n.derive();

    // Get and print the derivative value
    std::cout << "Derivative Value: " << n.getDerivatedVal() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program initializes a neuron, activates it, calculates its derivative, and prints the results. Let me know
